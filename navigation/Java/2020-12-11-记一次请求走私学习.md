### How to prevent HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities

HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities arise in situations where a front-end server forwards multiple requests to a back-end server over the same network connection, and the protocol used for the back-end connections carries the risk that the two servers disagree about the boundaries between requests. Some generic ways to prevent HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities arising are as follows:

- Disable reuse of back-end connections, so that each back-end request is sent over a separate network connection.
- Use HTTP/2 for back-end connections, as this protocol prevents ambiguity about the boundaries between requests.
- Use exactly the same web server software for the front-end and back-end servers, so that they agree about the boundaries between requests.

In some cases, vulnerabilities can be avoided by making the front-end server normalize ambiguous requests or making the back-end server reject ambiguous requests and close the network connection. However, these approaches are potentially more error-prone than the generic mitigations identified above.
